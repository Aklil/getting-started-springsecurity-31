About
=================

Source Code and materials for [Getting Started with Spring Security 3.1 from SpringOne 2012](http://www.springone2gx.com/conference/washington/2012/10/session?id=27680). To run the samples import the project into Spring Tool Suite using the Gradle Eclipse plugin.


Running the sample project
==================

The following provides information on setting up a development environment that can run the sample in [Spring Tool Suite 3.0.0+](http://www.springsource.org/sts). Other IDE's should work using Gradle's IDE support, but have not been tested.

* IDE Setup
  * Install Spring Tool Suite 3.0.0+
  * You will need the following plugins installed (can be found on the Extensions Page)
	* Gradle Eclipse
* Importing the project into Spring Tool Suite
  * File->Import...->Gradle Project

Trying Spring Security JavaConfig
=================
The javaconfig branch contains a demonstration of what the Spring Security Java Configuration support may look like. This is certainly not complete, nor a clean solution. However, it should give users an idea of what will be happening.
